    <h1 align="center"><b>Runtime</b></h1>
</p>

The runtime is an [SBE](src/sbe.md) and [SBF](src/sbf.md) interpreter that will run the bytecode generated by the [Sphere Compiler](https://github.com/NullifyDev/Sphere) and implement its own standard functions if in a freestanding environment.<br>
<br>
The runtime can only start running while at least one process is running. Processes can be started by executing an [SBE](src/sbe.md) file.

The Sphere Compiler can be found [here](https://github.com/NullifyDev/Sphere)

Only through Runtime can SBFs load SBEs.

|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`sphere start <dir/to/executable.sbe>`| runs the provided sbe                                                    |
|`sphere end <dir/to/executable.sbe>`  | sends quit signals to all processes within the given                     | 
|`sphere end <pid>`                    | sends a quit signal to the process wit the id                            |
|`sphere kill <pid>`                   | kills the process and frees the related memory entirely                  |
|`sphere kill <dir/to/executable.sbe>` | kills all processes and frees the related memory entirely                |
|`sphere pause <pid>`                  | pauses the process and skips its execution until resumed                 |
|`sphere resume <pid>`                 | resumes the process and continues from the last instruction              |


## Basics

### Memory
Each process has an address and length. The pointers within the process are indexed instead of giving absolute location (the true location of the pointer or object in question)
The Data Memory and Function Memory is separated and placed in a random location within the memory.
